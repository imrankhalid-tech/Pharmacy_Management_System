# Pharmacy_Management_System

The goal of this project is to store medicine stock data, all sale purchase information, day by day reports and backup plans, 
fully functioning single and 2D barcode reader accessibility, and safe running and storage strategies.
I am using MySQL as a database that is totally secured by the user authorization system in order to achieve greater scalability and 
better performance with respect to the pure heartbeat mechanism.

Some important non-functional requirements to consider when evaluating a pharmacy information management system include:
* System availability
* Allowance for maintainability and enhancements
* Recovery from failure
* Reliability
* Response time
* Throughput

The PMS must support systems such as automated dispensing cabinets and storage and retrieval systems that automate and manage inventory 
throughout the receiving, storage, retrieval, and distribution process. Requirements should include:
-> Real-time, on-hand inventory information at the time of patient-specific medication ordering and/or verification and fulfillment
-> Inventory control across multiple facilities
-> The ability to automate wholesale medication-ordering processes
-> Automated workflow in the distribution process with sequenced orders that guide staff through emergency, high-priority, routine, and batch order fulfillment
